# Classical-Laminate-Theory-App


This Classical Laminate Theory App is a powerful, interactive tool designed for engineers, researchers, and students working with composite materials. The app allows users to explore, calculate, and visualize the mechanical behavior of layered composite laminates using Classical Laminate Theory (CLT). With a sleek and intuitive interface, users can input specific laminate configurations, including the number of layers, ply angles, and layer thicknesses, to compute the ABD matrices â€” essential in understanding the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness of the laminate.

Key features of the app include:

* Real-time Calculation of ABD Matrices: Get instantaneous results for the extensional stiffness [A], coupling stiffness [B], and bending stiffness [D] matrices based on your input.
* Customizable Laminate Input: Easily modify the number of layers, angles, and thicknesses to simulate different laminate configurations.
* Strain Distribution Visualization: The app generates dynamic strain distribution plots across the laminate thickness, helping you visualize how different layers behave under loading conditions.
* Interactive and Visual: Powered by Plotly for rich, detailed graphs and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, this app combines both technical accuracy and ease of use.
* Whether you're studying the fundamentals of composite materials or analyzing complex laminate systems for your projects, this app delivers a powerful platform to enhance your understanding and decision-making process.
